        <h2>FAQ — Healthcare License Consultancy in Dubai</h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <details>
            <summary>Can a consultancy guarantee my DHA license?</summary>
            <p>
              No reputable consultancy can guarantee approval. Final decisions rest with regulators like DHA, MOHAP and DOH.
              What a consultancy can offer is organisation, context and support in responding to queries.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How long does the licensing journey usually take?</summary>
            <p>
              Many clinicians complete the process in roughly 6–12 weeks, but timing depends on document quality,
              DataFlow response times, exam slots and facility onboarding speed.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Is it worth paying for help if I’m comfortable with online systems?</summary>
            <p>
              If you enjoy admin and reading policy PDFs, you may not need a consultant. If you prefer curated guidance,
              checklists and someone to sanity-check your file, a focused partner like
